# PhysiX
This is a simple game coded in C inspired of "The World of Goo"

If you want to customize the game, run the file "index.html" in the repistories : Doxygen/html/

The file "physics.bin" is compiled for Linux so if you want to play the game, you need to open a terminal and write this command in the current repistory : ./physics.bin
